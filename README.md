Abeg is a simple decentralized airdrop web app where creator can create a giveaway and other user can join to participate and earn Celo Token.

## Issues/Challenges

There are many airdrop platforms, but we get to realized that identity verification is one of the biggest challenges some of the platform are suffering but with Celo Social connect SDK we get to verify user address with respect to their phone number and this prevent the use of bot to participate in giveaway also prevent single user from joining one giveaway in multiple.
